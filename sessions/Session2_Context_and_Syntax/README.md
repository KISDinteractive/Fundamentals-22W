## 2.1 Origins of the Computer

We started with some content and context about the origins and history of the modern computers we use for programming.

### Counting and Numbers

- Counting → important since beginning of humanity. Carving lines into sticks has been used fro thousands of years for recording e.g. debts.
- Counting visible things (e.g. with fingers) is simple. Higher numbers and math operations need systems.
- Decimal system was developed in different places and times. Still no positional number system to write down numbers effectively.
- Hindu-Arabic numerals (and the positional system), which we know today, spread from India via the Arabic region to Europe. Similar decimal systems also existed in China.
- Roman numerals were predominant until a few hundred years ago. They could only be used to write down numbers, but not to perform mathematical operations with them (no pure positional system, but decimal numbers).

### Calculation Machines

- Oldest and most famous is the "Abacus". Long before hindu-arabic numerals!
- Again, development took place at various places and times. Sometimes connected, sometimes independent. 
- **Why is this of relevance for computers?** For centuries and centuries → the Abacus wasn't just the number one calculating tool but the only one (besides mental arithmetic).
- First mechanical devices around 400 years ago → next chapter

### Mechanical Calculators

- While complex theorems were developed in mathematics, the actual calculations were still performed by hand.

- Three people are considered as the "the first" and also most inspiring in the field of mechanical calculation devices:
  
  - Wilhelm Schickard (1592-1653)
  - Blaise Pascal (1623-1662)
  - Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz (1646-1716)

- All had the same problem: manufacturing of the mechanical parts lacked in precision and longevity → machines would have worked in theory but got jammed after a short time.

- Many variants and enhancements in 18th and 19th century without real breakthroughs. 

- Serial production in the beginning of the 20th century → availability for science and business, not affordable for home use

- For the consumer market, the first affordable calculators became available in the 1970s when electronic calculators from Japanese brands such as Sanyo, Canon, Sharp and Casio entered the market.

- Methods for performing complex math operations on a piece of paper had been introduced over the last centuries as well – we will not go into further detail in the context of this course.
