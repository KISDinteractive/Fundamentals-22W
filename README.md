# Interactive Systems [Fundamentals] at KISD – Winter Term 2022/23

Welcome to the repository (repo) of the KISD Interactive Systems [Fundamentals] course. 
You are currently at the root of the repository with the "README" file. Every well-structured repo has this file, which gives an overview of what the repo is about, who the authors are, how to use the content, and how to contribute or ask questions.

## The Course
This course will take place in the winter semester 2022/23 at the [Köln International School of Design](https://kisd.de) in Cologne, Germany. The description reads:

> Code and algorithms are the materials from which essential aspects of our social, cultural and economic future are built. When designing these interactive systems and objects, a substantial understanding of the underlying technology (hardware) and the executed algorithm or program code (software) is essential. With the increase of such systems in everyday life, there is an increasing need to approach these topics in the context of design studies (especially in interaction/interface/product design) and to develop the ability to develop such prototypes.

> In this crash course (5 longer sessions with breaks) we learn the absolute basics of programming and look at individual aspects of the subject complex: What is a programming language and why are there so many of them? On which devices and platforms does which code run and how do I get it on there? How and where do I write, develop and store code and how do I execute it?

> No previous knowledge is required for participation. Directly after the course, there will be two further "Interactive Systems [Application]" courses in which you can apply what you have learned. Insofar as these can be chosen, it is recommended to attend one or, if you are interested, both courses.

## Why this repo?
We will post the slides, content and code of the sessions here as soon as we finish them. This way you can follow the content if you ever can't attend, or want to rework or copy the code at home.

## Authors
This repo is maintained by [Jakob Kilian](https://github.com/jakobkilian) and [Jakob Kilian](https://github.com/edipa), who also give the course.
