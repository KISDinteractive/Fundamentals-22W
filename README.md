***Disclaimer:*** *This repo documents an Interaction Design course held at [KISD](https://kisd.de) in the winter term 2022/23. In the "sessions" section you can find supporting material to the four sessions for consolidation or rework in case of missed meetings. Please keep in mind that the transcript was not written for (scientific) completeness _and that reading without participation_ in the course is of limited value.*

## Intro

Welcome to the repository of the KISD Interactive Systems [Fundamentals] course. 
You are currently at the root of the repository with the "README" file. Every well-structured repo has this file, which gives an overview of what the repo is about, who the authors are, how to use the content, and how to contribute or ask questions.

## The Course

This course will take place in the winter semester of 2022/23 at the [K√∂ln International School of Design](https://kisd.de) in Cologne, Germany. The description reads:

<summary style="font-size:14px"><b>View Course Description</b></summary>
<p><i>
Code and algorithms are the materials from which essential aspects of our social, cultural and economic future are built. When designing these interactive systems and objects, a substantial understanding of the underlying technology (hardware) and the executed algorithm or program code (software) is essential. With the increase of such systems in everyday life, there is an increasing need to approach these topics in the context of design studies (especially in interaction/interface/product design) and to develop the ability to develop such prototypes.</i></p><p><i>

In this crash course (5 longer sessions with breaks) we learn the absolute basics of programming and look at individual aspects of the subject complex: What is a programming language and why are there so many of them? On which devices and platforms does which code run and how do I get it on there? How and where do I write, develop and store code and how do I execute it?</i></p><p><i>

No previous knowledge is required for participation. Directly after the course, there will be two further "Interactive Systems [Application]" courses in which you can apply what you have learned. Insofar as these can be chosen, it is recommended to attend one or, if you are interested, both courses.
</i></p></details>

## Why this repo?

We will post the slides, content and code of the sessions here as soon as we finish them. This way you can follow the content if you ever can't attend, or want to rework or copy the code at home.

## Authors

This repo is maintained by [Jakob Kilian](https://github.com/jakobkilian) and [Eduard Paal](https://github.com/edipa), who also give the course.
